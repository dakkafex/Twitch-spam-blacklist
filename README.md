# Twitch Spam Blacklists
hello,
This is an attempt to create a centralized repository for curated lists for the most popular streaming tools, like Nightbot.

Apart from just regular phrases, the lists also incorporates regular expressions ([regex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression))
<sub>don't worry if you have never heard of it, that's what this list is for ðŸ˜‰

There are different lists for different content. 
Are you a mature stream but want to bar racial slurs, including ones spelled in a way to get around simple content filters* : 

 - *hey streamer, i think you are a dirty d o o d o o face*

You can for example choose to copy the racial slurs list, or if you want to keep sexual remarks out of your chat, use the sexual comments list.

**Do keep in mind**
That these lists aren't perfect and are not a catch all solution to moderating your community, people are always going to find ways around filters.

The main intention (in our case at least) for using blacklists, is to stop bots, spammers, trolls and the likes.
It is up to you to create the community you want instead of muzzling them, because nobody likes overzealous chat filters. 
## Instructions
In order to make use of these lists, simply check out the directory and look for the list that applies to your use case, copy the text and paste it in your blacklists settings.

**For Nightbot:**
 1. Go to your dashboard.
 2. Go to the **Spam Protection** page.
 3. Go to the options of  **Blacklist Words/Phrases**(make sure it is enabled).
 4. Paste the raw text into **Blacklist** option.
 5. Save the list.

## Improve the lists
Everyone is welcome to improve the list, just fork the repo and make a pull request when you are done so it can be added to our main repository. 

## Notes

\* These methodes do require regex support in your bot/tool
